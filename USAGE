To use QSFit you should have IDL (ver >= 8.1) and Gnuplot (ver. >=5.0)
installed.

Start an IDL session and change to the directory where you stored the
QSFit files, e.g.:

  IDL> CD, 'C:\the\path\where\qsfit\code\is\located'   (on windows)

or 

  IDL> CD, '/the/path/where/qsfit/code/is/located'   (on Linux)


______________________________________________________________________
Compile the QSFit procedures and dependencies:
  IDL> compile

The "compile" procedure and QSFit routines can not be used within the
same procedure.  Best practice is to call "compile" manually, at the
very beginning of the IDL session.

Note that you do not have to modify your IDL_PATH settings to use
QSFit.


______________________________________________________________________
Download the spectra FITS files:

currently only SDSS DR10 FITS files are supported by QSFit.  These
files can be downloaded from:
http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr10/en/tools/explore/obj.aspx

click, on "Search", enter search cirteria and click on "Go".  Verify
the resulting object is the one you're interested in and click on
"FITS" (in the middle of the column on the left), and on "Download".

Alternativaly you may copy and paste an URL similar to the following:

http://dr10.sdss3.org/sas/dr10/sdss/spectro/redux/26/spectra/0752/spec-0752-52251-0323.fits

directly on the web browser.  The number to be tweaked are:
- the plate ID (0752 in the example above. NOTE: this number appears twice in the URL!)
- the MJD (52251 in the example above)
- the fiber ID (0323 in the example above)

The QSFit package comes already with one such file in the "data"
directory.  This can be used to quickly test the QSFit procedures (see
below).

______________________________________________________________________
Run the analysis for a specific source:

  IDL> in = qsfit_input('data/spec-0752-52251-0323.fits', type='SDSS_DR10', z=0.3806, ebv=0.06846)
  IDL> res = qsfit(in)

Parameters are:
 - the path to a SDSS-DR10 FITS file
 - the redshift of the source
 - the color excess

The results are returned in the "res" variable.

______________________________________________________________________
If you want the results to be saved in a directory (which must have
been previously created) use the OUTNAME keyword, e.g.

  IDL> res = qsfit(in, outname='output/MySavedFile')

This will save all the logs in a file named
output/MySavedFile_QSFIT.log and the results in
output/MySavedFile_QSFIT.dat.  The latter contains a binary
representation of the results, and can be used to restore those data
in IDL.  Note that if you run again the above command the program will
stop immediately with a message:

File output/MySavedFile_QSFIT.dat already exists

This is not an error, it simply says that the analysis has already
been performed and there is no need to run it again.  To actually
re-run the analysis you should manually delete that file.

______________________________________________________________________
Plot the results:
  IDL> qsfit_plot, res

To plot the data rebinned by a factor of 5:
  IDL> res.gfit.obs.(0).plot.rebin = 5
  IDL> qsfit_plot, res

______________________________________________________________________
To save the gnuplot files in a specific path:
  IDL> qsfit_plot, res, filename='output/MySavedFile'

Note that the directory "output" must have been previously created and
that the file name must not have any extension.  Two files will be
created: one with the ".gp" extension and one with the "_resid.gp"
suffix.  The former is the actual plot, to compare the data and the
model.  The latter is the plot of the residuals.

These are just gnuplot files, and IDL is not needed to handle them.
You can simply load them into gnuplot for the gnuplot shell:

  gnuplot> load 'output/MySavedFile.gp'

or modify them for to suite your goal.  If you use a modern terminal
for gnuplot, such as "wxt" (which is the default in ver. 5.0) you
may use the "Export to plot file" button to obtain a pdf copy.

Alternatively you may modify the plot files by changing the line:

  set term wxt

with

  set term pdf
  set output 'filename.pdf'

and reload the file in gnuplot.

______________________________________________________________________
Monte Carlo resampling:

To run the Monte Carlo reampling method (see corresponding section in
the reference paper) simply add the RESAMPLE= keyword in the qsfit
call, e.g.:

  IDL> res = qsfit(in, resample=10)

The result variable will be an array of 1000 elements (or whatver
number you set with the RESAMPLE keyword) where the first is the
actual analysis on the real data, while the remaining ones will be the
analysis on the mock data generated from the best fit model of the
actual analysis.

______________________________________________________________________
QSFit Customization:

Some details of QSFit behavior can be customized through the
!QSFIT_OPT global variable.  Check the qsfit_prepare_options
procedure for a list of default values and their meaning.

For instance, to enable/disable the Balmer continuum component set 
`!qsfit_opt.balmer` to 1/0 respcetively.

To add absorption lines at 2705A and 3810A set
`!qsfit_opt.abslines_wavelengths = '2705, 3810'`

etc...

Further customization can be performed by modifying the source code in
qsfit.pro.  Check the documentation in the reference paper and in the
code itself.


______________________________________________________________________
Multiple dataset:

Starting from v1.3.0 QSFit allows to analyze multiple data sets
simultaneously.  E.g. to consider both the optical spectrum and photometry from SDSS:

  IDL> in1 = qsfit_input('data/spec-0752-52251-0323.fits', type='SDSS_DR10', z=0.3806, ebv=0.06846)
  IDL> in2 = qsfit_input('data/photometry.txt', type='ASCII', z=0.3806, ebv=0.06846)
  IDL> res = qsfit(LIST(in1, in2))

Note that we used type='ASCII' to read the text file
data/photometry.txt which contains ASCII data in three (space
separated) columns: the wavelength (observer frame, in Angstrom), the
observed flux and its uncertainty (in units of 10-17 erg s^-1 cm^-1
A^-1).

Alternatively the data can be provided directly as numerical arrays
(with the same units as above), e.g.:

  IDL> in1 = qsfit_input('data/spec-0752-52251-0323.fits', type='SDSS_DR10', z=0.3806, ebv=0.06846)
  IDL> wavelength = [3588.52,4862.24,6289.31,7712.08,9230.77]
  IDL> flux = [14.6768,8.92081,6.38598,4.82714,4.85875]
  IDL> uncert = [0.391382,0.148469,0.150169,0.0933146, 0.147523]
  IDL> in2 = qsfit_input(wavelength, flux, uncert, z=0.3806, ebv=0.06846)
  IDL> res = qsfit(LIST(in1, in2))

To plot the results we can assign individual labels and plotting
options to each dataset, e.g.:

  IDL> res.gfit.obs.(0).data.(0).plot.label = 'Spectrum'
  IDL> res.gfit.obs.(0).data.(1).plot.label = 'Photometry'
  IDL> res.gfit.obs.(0).data.(1).plot.gp = 'w yerrorbars pt 7 ps 2 lt rgb "dark-green"'
  IDL> qsfit_plot, res
