**QSFit** (Quasar Spectral Fitting) is a software package written in
IDL to automatically perform the analysis of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) optical spectra. The software provides luminosity estimates for
the AGN continuum, the Balmer continuum, both optical and UV iron
blended complex, host galaxy and emission lines, as well as width,
velocity offset and equivalent width of 20 emission lines (Halpha,
Hbeta, Mgii, [Oiii], Civ, etc.).  The ultimate purpose of **QSFit** is
to allow astronomers to run standardized recipes to analyze the AGN
data, in a simple, replicable and shareable way. The whole fitting
process is customizable for specific needs, and can be extended to
analyze spectra from other data sources.
