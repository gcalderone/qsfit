- Mar. 21, 2018  (ver. 1.3.0)

	+ This release implements a new feature which allows to fit
	multiple spectra simultaneously, against either a single or
	multiple model expressions.  Also, this release is significantly
	faster (35-40%) than the previous one;

	+ The code has been largely refactored to implement the new
	features, but the results are identical to the previous version
	(v1.2.4) within the numerical accuracy, provided the
	!QSFIT_OPT.compat124 variable is set to 1.  By setting this
	variable to zero a few, minor, bugfix will come into play which
	may affect the results in a few cases.  The differences are
	however expected to be smaller than the quoted uncertainties;

	+ The calling sequence has changed to accomodate the new features,
	see the USAGE file for an example.

	+ The `tied` field of the parameter structure has been renamed to
	`expr`, and its purpose changed: when used with `fixed=0` it
	allows to specify a mathematical expression (possibly involving
	other parameters) evaluated before passing the result to the
	component function.  When used with `fixed=0` it is used to tie
	the value to other parameters (old behaviour);

- Mar. 03, 2018  (ver. 1.2.4)
	+ All calculations are now forced to be done with DOUBLE precision.
	This ensure the reproducibility of the results regardless of the
	data type of the redshift and color excess input parameters;

	+ Added support for three more emission lines: NV 1241, OI 1306
	and CII 1335;

	+ Bugfix: the QSFit software used to create the first published
	catalog (v1.2) had a bug in the code which freezes/thaws the iron
	template component at optical wavelengths.  This bug affected only
	the spectral estimates for the sources with z < 0.4.

	+ Bugfix: in very few cases QSFit computed the wrong spectral
	coverage for the emission lines, enabling their corresponding
	components instead of disabling them;

	+ Minor bugfix

	+ The whole QSFit catalog has been re-created using this QSFit
	version.  The results are available at the following address:
	http://qsfit.inaf.it/cat_1.24/

- Dec. 09, 2017  (ver. 1.2.3)
	+ QSFit now accept the `z=0` keyword, implying that the input data
	are already given in emitted luminosity (rather than observed
	flux), and the wavelengths are already in the source rest frame;

	+ We added the !QSFIT_OPT.min_wavelength option, to specify the
	minimum wavelength (in AA) to be considered in the fit.  Smaller
	wavelengths are ignored;

	+ We added the !QSFIT_OPT.accept_line_res option to specify the
	minimum emission line resolution (in km s^-1) to consider the line
	in the fit.  If the resolution of a line is smaller the whole line
	range is ignored;

	+ Minor bug fix.

- Nov 02, 2017  (ver. 1.2.2)
	+ QSFit is now able to read data from an ASCII text file (rather
	than from a SDSS DR10 FITS file): simply pass the `input='ASCII``
	keyword to `qsfit`;

- Jul 20, 2017  (ver. 1.2.1)
	+ QSFit is now able to fit a set of (manually added) absorption
	lines.  The list of absorption wavelengths must be specified
	through the !QSFIT_OPT.abslines_wavelengths global variable.

- Jul 19, 2017  (ver. 1.2)

	+ QSFit now defines a global variable upon initialization, named
	`!QSFIT_OPT`, containing several settings to customize the fitting
	behavior.  Check the qsfit_prepare_options for further details;

	+ The default host galaxy template is now SWIRE_ELL5
	(http://www.iasf-milano.inaf.it/~polletta/templates/swire_templates.html);

	+ By default, the continuum is now modeled with a single power law
	instead of a smoothly broken power law.  To restore the old
	behaviour set `continuum.dalpha.fixed = 0`;

	+ The four parts of the UV iron template are now joined in a
	single component;

	+ QSFit now estimates the equivalent widths for the iron and
	emission line components;

	+ A Monte Carlo resampling method has been implemented to
	accurately estimate the parameter uncertainties.  See the
	corresponding section in the reference paper;

	+ A new component to model the Balmer continuum and
	pseudo-continuum (blending of high order Balmer lines) has been
	added.


- May 29, 2017  (ver. 1.1)
	Minor updates to improve performances, accuracy of results and
	functionalities:

	+ QSFit: initial value for the continuum component slope is now
	-1.5 (in ver. 1.0 was -2);

	+ QSFit: emission lines rest frame wavelengths have been
	corrected;

	+ QSFit: solved the error occurring when the number of "unknown"
	emission lines was 0;

	+ QSFit components sbpowerlaw and emline: improved performances;

	+ Default gnuplot terminal is qt (in ver. 1.0 was wxt);

	First commit of QSFit package
